Which function uses the most cumulative time?
     1    0.084    0.084    0.084    0.084 code.py:4(distance_matrix)

What percentage of the total program run time does the slowest function occupy?
    Take the cum time, multiply by 100 and divide by the total run time.
    
Based on the profiling results, where should we focus our optimization efforts?
    Only the slowest function.
