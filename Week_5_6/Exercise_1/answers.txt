Suppose that a specific task consists of two subtasks. The first subtask retrieves data from a file; 
it takes 20 seconds to execute on a given system, and it cannot be parallelized. The second subtask processes 
a large number of data records; it takes 100 seconds to execute sequentially. Each data record can be processed 
independently, so the second subtask is easily parallelized.

1) What is the parallel fraction of the task consisting of the two subtasks?
    The parallel fraction is 100/120 = 0.83 (F).

2) What is the theoretical speedup for p = 10 processors?
    S = 1/((1-F) + F/p) = 1/((1-0.83) + 0.83/10) = 3.95 = 4.0

3) What is the theoretical maximum speedup?
    S(inf) = 1/(1-F) = 5.88 = 6.0

4) Imagine we currently have 4 processors available for parallization. To improve performance, we have two options:
    - Optimize the first subtask so we can retrieve the data from the file in 5 seconds instead of 20.
    - Purchase more processors so we have 8 processors available instead of 4.
    Optimize task one
