If SIZE is 40, how many bytes does the row vector mat = np.random.rand(1, SIZE) occupy?
    1 number in float = 8 bytes so a vector of shape 1x40 is 8*40=320 bytes

If SIZE is 35, how many bytes does the row vector mat = np.random.rand(SIZE, SIZE) occupy?
    1 number in float = 8 bytes so a matrix of shape 35x35 is 8*35*35=9800 bytes

For which arrays was using blosc with compression faster than NumPy?
    Zeros, tile

Which statement below is true when it comes to using compressed data?
    When data contains repeated parts compression is both faster and uses less space

What compression ratio does blosc achieve over numpy (size of .npy file / size of .bl file) for the zero arrays using lz4?
    100 or above

What changes when using zstd instead of lz4 (for zeros and tiles data at least)?
    Reading is the same, writing is slower, but it uses less space
